Independent double nozzle 3d printer for COREXY
 The project is still working! so Do not use it for any commercial purpose.
 Warning! This is not suitable for cowards,
 this is the use of three stepper motors to work together to synthesize x-axis, x1-axis and y-axis, 
 but this fitting is different from the fixed trigonometric function solution of incremental printer. 
 Therefore, the installation and adjustment of this structure are extremely brain burning. 
 If you are prepared enough to be patient and brave enough, you can follow me and you can also have a good dual carriage corexy printer: >
